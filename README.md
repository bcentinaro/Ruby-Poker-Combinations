## A Hand  calculator for 'Deadlands' Hucksters.

Just a quick overview of what the heck this tool is... in short, there's a table top RPG called 'Deadlands'. Where a group of magically inclinded people cast spells by drawing cards and making poker hands.

The character is able to draw anywhere between 6 and 13 cards, to determine 'success'. In the game failure (the inability to even make an ace high) comes with some very bad things.

I built this program to calculate the % of certain hands, based upon the number of cards drawn. 

Please, not this is not of any real use in actual poker play, at least as it currently stands.
